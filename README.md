# fahad648-NUMPY-FOR-DATA-SCIENCE-Part-02
NumPy (short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers. In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in list type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size. Numpy has many built-in functions and capabilities. We won't cover them all but instead we will focus on some of the most important aspects of Numpy: vectors,arrays,matrices, and number generation.

In Part-02 we have some new Indexing Techniques of Numpy and its Selections
We Discover How Numpy Array Differ From Pyhton List 

In Part-02 We Discover Numpy Basic Operations As well
